NES-I/O
========

an idea by Arcade-TV from circuit-board.de :) Thank you very much!!!

The board replaces the silver box in NES frontloader. On this PCB the following components are included:

- AC input jack
- AC to DC conversion
- MultiAV (SNES and GC are supported)
- PIC16F684 microcontroller to control the NESRGB color palette and reset the console using your controller :D

All components you need are stated on the silkscreen. An complete overview as well as an English installation guide is coming soon ;)
