Components:

IC1: PIC16F684 SOIC-14 with NESRGB-IGR code. Please choose whether you want to use a dual LED with a common anode or cathode in advance!
IC2: 74LVX125 SOIC-14

C1, C2: 100nF 0805
R1, R2: 220Ohm 0805

Jumper:

J1: 10kOhm 0805 -> set the reset type of your console there.
J2: Short the jumper you want to... '3' means that the PIC cycles only through the RGB modes; '4' als cycles through RGB off
